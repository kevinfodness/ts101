# Lesson 1: Introduction to TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a language that extends the functionality of another programming
language called JavaScript. JavaScript is the language that powers interactive
features in your web browser (like games, social media sites, and search
engines).

> A programming language that has all of the features of another language plus
> additional features is called a "superset."

## Why TypeScript?

We will be using TypeScript for this course for a few reasons:

- It has the simplicity of JavaScript but with the addition of data types,
  which makes it easy to pick up while still learning important concepts
- Microsoft maintains a free online "playground" for writing and testing code,
  which means you can write TypeScript from any computer with a web browser
  without needing to install any additional software
- TypeScript (and JavaScript) are used extensively in actual computer jobs,
  which makes it a practical language to learn at any level

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate to the
[TypeScript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).

The TypeScript playground has three important areas that we will be using:

1. **The code editor.** This is the part on the left that has a lot of text in
   it which you can edit. When loaded for the first time, it should start with
   `// Welcome to the TypeScript Playground`.
2. **The Run button.** This button is right above the code editor and we will be
   clicking it a lot. This is what will run the programs that you write.
3. **The output area.** This is the pane that is to the right of the code
   editor. This pane has a few tabs on it. We will mostly be using the **Logs**
   tab.

## Running Our First Program

When you load the TypeScript playground for the first time, it should come with
a sample program that looks something like this:

```ts
const anExampleVariable = "Hello World"
console.log(anExampleVariable)
```

> If you don't see this program, you can copy and paste it in from these
> instructions.

Click the **Run** button above the code editor and the pane on the right should
switch to the **Logs** tab. You should see the output of your program, which
should say `[LOG]: "Hello World"`.

Bookmark the TypeScript playground in your web browser so it is easy to come
back to for future lessons.

Congratulations! You have run your first TypeScript program.
