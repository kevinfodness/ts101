# Practice 3: Variable Types

1. Navigate to the TypeScript playground using the bookmark you made.
2. Declare a variable for each of the following and give it the appropriate type for the value you are assigning.
   1. Your name
   2. Your age
   3. Whether you like broccoli or not
   4. A list of your favorite foods
3. For each of the variables you created, what type did you give them? Why?
4. Define an `interface` to describe a car. What properties does a car have? What types should those properties be?
5. Create a variable for a car that uses the `interface` you just created. This can be for your car, or your dream car,
   or whatever you like. Assign properties for the car to the object.
6. Declare a variable that could contain a number or a boolean. Try giving it various numeric and boolean values.
