# Practice 4: Boolean Logic

1. Navigate to the TypeScript playground using the bookmark you made.
2. Declare a variable for a password and give it the value `"banana"`.
3. Write a boolean logic check to see if it matches the correct password of `"banana"` (which it should). You can output
   this to the console using `console.log`, like: `console.log(password === "banana")`
4. Change the value of the variable so that the result of the boolean logic returns `false`.
5. Create a new variable for a username and give it the value `"monkey"`.
6. Update the boolean logic check to ensure that the username is `"monkey"` and the password is `"banana"`. Run it.
   What happens? Why?
7. Update the values of your variables so that the check passes for both the username and password.
8. Experiment with changing the username, then the password, then both, to incorrect values, and ensure the check works
   as you would expect. It should only print `true` if both the username and the password are correct.
