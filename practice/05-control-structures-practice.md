# Practice 5: Control Structures

1. Navigate to the TypeScript playground using the bookmark you made.
2. Create a variable to hold a temperature value in degrees. Make sure you give the variable the proper type.
3. Prompt the user for a temperature value and store it in the variable. Make sure you cast it to the proper type.
4. For this next part, you can assume the temperature value is in Fahrenheit or Celsius (your choice):
	a. If the temperature is at or below the freezing point, tell the user that water will freeze at this temperature.
	b. If the temperature is at or above the boiling point, tell the user that water will boil at this temperature.
	c. If the temperature is not freezing or boiling, tell the user that water will not freeze or boil at this temperature.
5. Test your program with the following values and make sure it works properly:
	a. A number below the freezing point
	b. The exact freezing point
	c. A number above the boiling point
	d. The exact boiling point
	e. A number between the freezing and boiling point
6. Extend your program to ask the user for the temperature scale they want to use after providing the temperature. You will need to declare another variable for this purpose and give it the proper type. Instruct the user to enter C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit. Modify your program's logic so that it works with either Celsius or Fahrenheit inputs and test it thoroughly.

BONUS: Extend your program to add support for temperatures in the Kelvin (K) scale. What will you need to modify in order to get this to work?
