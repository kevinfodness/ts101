# Practice 2: Variables

1. Navigate to the TypeScript playground using the bookmark you made.
2. Declare a constant named `myBirthYear` and set it to the 4-digit year of your
   birth.
3. Why is your birth year a constant instead of a variable?
4. Declare a variable named `myAge` and set it to your current age.
5. Why is your age a variable and not a constant?
6. Use the `console.log` function and mathematical operators to output how old
   you will be in 50 years.
